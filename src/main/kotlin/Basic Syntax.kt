/* Kotlin is statically typed, meaning the code is continuously compiled for errors before execution.
It uses less code and supports null safety.
Kotlin's variables are non-null by default, and must hold a value.
Kotlin is interoperable with Java, as it runs on JVM.
It supports higher-order functions.
Kotlin has very fast compilation time.
Kotlin is tool-friendly, and major IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Android Studio can run it.

An expression consists of variables, methods and operators to produce a single value.
The following are not expressions: variable declaration, value assignment, and class declaration.
All functions are expressions, since they return at least a value of Unit.

A statement is any expression for an action to be carried out.
Variable declarations are statements, as are variable initializations, e.g., val x = 2
You can have more than one statement in a line, like, val x = 2; val y = "why"

A block any piece of code enclosed by curly brackets. All functions are code blocks.
Any variable declared at the head of a block is accessible throughout the block,
unless another one with the same name is declared inside the block

A variable exists only inside the block of code where it has been declared.
Naming variables should follow the lowerCamelCase format.

var badVariable = 9 //variables can be declared at the top level, or globally,
they will be accessed anywhere within the code.
This is not encouraged.

//------------FUNCTIONS:---------------

//functions are blocks of code that run when called/invoked by another part of the code.
//why functions? modularity (breakable),  reusable, abstraction of complex logic,
//and also improved readability of code.

//you can pass data called parameters into a function, also called arguments.
//you can have as many parameters as you wish.
//remember parameters are read-only or val by default, so don't use val or val, as explained further below.


//NOTE: Functions DO NOT have constructors, and only have parameters e.g., myFun(a:Char, b: Int)
//NOTE: When declaring function parameters, you cannot use the val or val keywords.
//The val keyword is used to declare properties (variables) within a CLASS, not for function parameters.

//functions can also return values, and also encapsulate logic into reusable blocks of code.

//functions can be said, in general, to be either user-defined or built-in.

//examples of built-in functions include main(), arrayOf(), sum() and println()



fun myFunc(firstName: String){
    println("$firstName Doe.")
}


//return statement
//functions have the ability to return values, which are passed back to where the function was evoked.
//for it to work, we need to put a return type to the function header
//and also a return statement in the function body

fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int { //simple function with two parameters and an Int return type, and a body
    return a + b
}

fun diff(a: Int, b: Int) = a-b //simple function with two parameters but doesn't have a body
                              // this is a single expression function, where the body is the expression

fun prod(a:Int, b:Int){ //simple function that does not return anything, or a void function.
                       // it simply prints out a product value
    println("The product is ${a*b}")
}

//when calling a function with arguments in the main() function,
//the arguments should be passed in the order defined in the function.

//If you're not using named arguments,
//then the arguments should be passed in the order they are defined in the function.

//This is the default behavior in Kotlin.

//If you're using named arguments,
// then you can pass the arguments in any order by explicitly specifying the parameter names
//in the function call.

//example below

fun myStudent( sName: String= "", sGrade: String = "Grade 5" , sRollNo: Int = 12 ) {

    println("The name of the student is: $sName")
    println("The grade of the student is: $sGrade")

} //end of function, check the call in the main() function


//functions can be simplified further through literals
//these are unnamed functions that can be treated as a value.
//they include anonymous functions and lambda expressions
//these are best used in the main() function, check above in main() function...


//a function can have named arguments.
// these give values to the arguments if none are given during a function call

}

//Function Recursion

//A function that calls itself is a recursive function
//The process of repetition id called recursion
//When a function os called, there is either a normal call or a recursive call.
//Since most standard function calls are normal, this section focuses on how a recursive call works.

//Every recursive function should have a condition for termination otherwise there is an infinite loop.

//The code below defines a function called callMe, which takes an integer parameter "a"
//It prints the value of the parameter "a"
//It checks if "a" is greater than 0.
//If "a" is greater than 0, it calls the callMe function again with the argument a-1.
// This is a recursive call, meaning the function calls itself with a smaller value of "a".
//The recursive call continues until a becomes 0 or negative.
//Each time the function is called recursively, it prints the value of "a" again.

//The main function then calls the callMe function with the integer argument "5" or whatever deems fit.
//So, when the main function is called, it will invoke the callMe function with 5.
//The callMe function will print 5, then call itself again with a-

//This process will repeat until a becomes 0, resulting in the output: 5,4,3,2,1,0.

fun callMe(a: Int){

    print("$a ")

    if (a>0) {
        callMe(a-1)
    }

//print("$a ") //note that if the print statement were to be put here after the if condition
//then the output would be in reverse from 0,1,2,3,4,5
//this would be because the function, after making all the recursive calls from the if statement...
//...would now return back to all its previous calls from 0 to 5, effected in the print statement

//in other concise words, when the base case is reached and callMe(0) is executed, it prints the value 0.
//At this point, the base case does not make any further recursive calls,
//so it returns directly to the previous instance of the function that called it,
//which is callMe(1).

// The value 0 is printed, and callMe(1) continues its execution from where it left off,
//after the recursive call.

//Then, the same process repeats for callMe(1) and its recursive call to callMe(0).
//Once callMe(1) reaches its base case and prints 1, it returns to the previous instance callMe(2).

//This process continues, with each recursive call returning to the previous instance and...
//...printing its respective value until the original function call callMe(5) is reached,
//and completes the execution.

//So, in summary after the base case (0 in this example) is printed,
//the function instances that were called in the recursion process
//print their respective values one by one as they return from their recursive calls.

//This process continues until the initial function call completes...
//..resulting in the reverse printing of values from the base case back to the original call.

}

//Recursion as a means of finding the factorial of a number.


// -> this first code will not work.
//the function myFactorial does not have a base case, which is a condition to stop the recursion.
//the function myFactorial will keep calling itself with a smaller variable,
//down and past 0 and into infinity.

//This will result in an infinite loop and eventually cause a "StackOverflowError"
//because there is no base case to stop the recursion.

//The base case is essential to stop the recursion and prevent infinite loops.

fun myFactorial(factorialNum: Int):Int{

    return factorialNum * myFactorial(factorialNum-1)
}

fun main(){
    println("The factorial of this number is: "+myFactorial(5))
}

*/

// -> this second code will work
//the issue from the first code is fixed by adding a base case: if(factorialNum == 1) factorialNum.toLong().
//When the factorialNum is equal to 1, the function simply returns 1, and the recursion stops.
//This way, the function can correctly calculate the factorial of a given number...
//...by repeatedly multiplying it with smaller factorial values until it reaches the base case.

//the line factorialNum * myFactorial(factorialNum - 1)
//results in a function call with a number one less than the current one.

//This is a crucial part of recursion because it breaks down the original problem into smaller,
//more manageable sub-problems.

/*

Let's find the factorial of 3 using this code:

We call the myFactorial function with the argument 3.
The function checks the base case: factorialNum == 1. Since factorialNum is 3,
it does not equal 1, so we move to the else part.

In the else part, we have factorialNum * myFactorial(factorialNum - 1).
Here, factorialNum is 3. So we calculate 3 * myFactorial(3 - 1).

We now have to calculate myFactorial(2). We call the myFactorial function again with the argument 2.
The function checks the base case: factorialNum == 1. Since factorialNum is 2, it does not equal 1,
so we move to the else part.

In the else part, we have factorialNum * myFactorial(factorialNum - 1).
Here, factorialNum is 2. So we calculate 2 * myFactorial(2 - 1).

We now have to calculate myFactorial(1). We call the myFactorial function again with the argument 1.
The function checks the base case: factorialNum == 1. Since factorialNum is 1, it equals 1.
So the function returns 1.

Now, we have the value of myFactorial(1), which is 1.
We go back to the previous step where we calculated 2 * myFactorial(2 - 1).
Replace myFactorial(1) with 1, so it becomes 2 * 1, which equals 2.

Now, we have the value of myFactorial(2), which is 2.
We go back to the previous step where we calculated 3 * myFactorial(3 - 1).
Replace myFactorial(2) with 2, so it becomes 3 * 2, which equals 6.

/* in a simple range of elements from 0-x */
//the "until" operator gives the range of elements from index 0 and excludes the last element in the range x
//the ".." operator gives the range of elements from index 0 to the last element x

/* in the code in question in the list */
//the range 0 until daysOfWeek.size includes indices 0 to 6,
//each for a day in the list, representing all the elements in the list

//The range 0..daysOfWeek.size includes the indices 0 to 7
//This is to mean all the indices 0-6, as well as index 7 (daysOfWeek.size),

//Since the daysOfWeek list has 7 elements (indices 0 to 6),

//To iterate over the valid indices of the daysOfWeek list,

//------------CLASSES:---------------

//A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects.
// It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class can possess.

// Classes encapsulate data and functionality together,
//allowing you to create multiple instances (objects) based on the class definition.
// Classes are used for creating complex data structures and organizing code into reusable modules.
// They facilitate object-oriented programming principles like inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

class Book { //name starts with an upper case letter
            //this class has the default values set in the properties

    var pages = 320 //properties of the class initialized with values
    val title = "Best of the Rest"
    val author = "Robert Leeds"
}

//classes also have primary constructors, which are the brackets after the class name
//these allow us to declare properties and initialize them when we instantiate an object

//NOTE: In a class, you need to use the val or var keywords,
// before the parameters in the primary constructor declaration.

// This is to make constructor parameters accessible as PROPERTIES within the class
// This allows you to access and use the values throughout the class.

//WITHOUT the val or var keywords before the constructor parameters,
//the parameters will not be considered properties of the class.

//Instead, they will be treated as local variables within the primary constructor.
//This means you won't be able to access or use these values outside the constructor.

//Example class MyClass (val a:Int, x:Int) .."x" is only a local variable,
//unlike "a" which is a class property

class Person(val name: String, val age: Int) //no default values set in the properties


class Hobbies (val myHobby: String)

//Look at this class below.

//We know that class constructors contain properties which need to use the val/var keywords
//in order to be accessed as properties within the class or outside.

//The class below shows a few modifications to show how Kotlin handles data

//One can see that fName, lName, and yearBorn do not have val/var keywords
//This means that unlike typical class properties in the constructor,
//they are not accessed outside the class directly, making them local variables.

//They are only used to initialize the "empFullName" and "empAge" properties,
//but are not stored as separate properties themselves.

//This is in contrast to the yearsWorked,
//which is directly accessed as a property in the main function after the class has been instantiated.

//Also note currentYear is set as PRIVATE.
//Class properties that have been set to "private" demonstrate the use of data encapsulation in Kotlin.
//Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming principle that aims to bundle data,
//and the methods that operate on that data together into a class.

//One aspect of encapsulation is controlling access to the data members of a class.
//By making currentYear private,
//one is able you restrict direct access to these properties from outside the class.

//This allows you to have better control over how these properties are accessed and modified.
//When a property is private, it can only be accessed within the class itself.

//In this class code, since you are not directly accessing this property outside the class,
//you can make them private to enforce encapsulation and prevent unintended modification.


class MyEmployee(fName: String, lName: String, val yearsWorked: Int, yearBorn: Int){
    //declaration of properties of a class needs to ALWAYS be in the class,
    //not inside an init block or member function.
    val empFullName = "$fName $lName"
    val empAge: Int
    private val currentYear = 2023

    //the init block
    // since the primary constructor has no code other than properties and their data types
    // we use an initializer block to make use of more logic from the properties
